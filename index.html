  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Each year millions of tons of food waste is sent to landfills to rot. This food then releases a harmful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Very few schools compost as an alternative to throwing food waste away. In order to improve the environment, more schools must implement a composting initiative immediately in order to reduce the total amount of trash going to landfills and the greenhouse gasses being released by that food.</p>
