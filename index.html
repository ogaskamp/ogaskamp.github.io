  <h1>Composting in Schools</h1>
  <p>Each year millions of tons of food waste is sent to landfills to rot. This food then releases a harmful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Very few schools compost as an alternative to throwing food waste away. In order to improve the environment, more schools must implement a composting initiative immediately in order to reduce the total amount of trash going to landfills and the greenhouse gasses being released by that food.</p>
  <h2>What is composing?</h2>
	  <p>Composting is the process of turning organic material into compost which can be used as a fertilizer. Composting is a good alternative to throwing food waste away because it reduces the amount of methane gas being released into the atmosphere</p>
	<h2>Benefits of Composting</h2>
	<p>Composting has many benefits. When food waste goes to a landfill, it releases a harmful greenhouse gas called methane. Food waste is the single most common material landfilled and incinerated in the U.S., comprising 24 and 22 percent of landfilled and combusted solid waste. (Environmental Protection Agency). </p>
	<h2>Food Waste in Schools</h2>
	<p>Large amounts of food is being wasted every day at schools. An elementary school in Nebraska was able to reduce the amount of food thrown out from 150 pounds to only 18 pounds during a three week period by composting (DeLaRosa and Modan). The elementary school was able to go from not composting at all to composting 90% of all food waste in three weeks. By composting uneaten food, schools can easily reduce the amount of food being thrown out. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that U.S. schools waste over 530,000 tons of food annually. Of that 530,000 tons a very small percentage is composted.</p>
	<h2>Implement Composting</h2>
	<p>There are multiple ways that schools could implement composting. Many compost collection companies exist that work similarly to recycling. A school in Beverly Massachusetts was able to successfully implement composting using Black Earth Compost, which is a compost collection company. A much less expensive option to implement composting would be for the school to do their own composting. The school could create a bin outside to put food scraps in and create fertilizer. Composting can be very easy to start doing and is a much better alternative to throwing all of the food waste away.</p>
